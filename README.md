# Go Study web

The React frontend runs on Vite while a same-origin Express backend handles Discord OAuth and PostgreSQL-backed sessions.

## Local setup

Prerequisites: Node.js 20 or newer and PostgreSQL.

1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and replace every placeholder.
3. Apply the SQL files in `migrations/` in numeric order. Migration `0003_create_reward_seen_rewards.sql` must run before deploying an application build that reads unseen-reward state.
4. In the Discord developer portal, register `http://localhost:3000/auth/discord/callback` as an OAuth redirect URI.
5. Start Express with `npm run dev:server`.
6. In another terminal, start Vite with `npm run dev`.

Vite listens on port 3000 and proxies `/api` and `/auth` to Express on port 8787. The OAuth request uses only Discord's `identify` scope.

## Authenticated data API

- `GET /api/dashboard` returns verified-time progress, the four most recent inventory instances, and `newRewardCount`.
- `GET /api/inventory?limit=20&cursor=<hourRewardId>` returns a bounded, descending keyset page as `{items, nextCursor}`; every instance includes `isNew`.
- `GET /api/catalog` returns the reward catalog ordered by its selection order.
- `POST /api/rewards/seen` atomically marks a batch of 1–50 owned reward instances as seen after Inventory renders them.

All product endpoints derive the Discord user ID from the server session. Inventory IDs are serialized as decimal strings.

## New reward state

Migration `0003_create_reward_seen_rewards.sql` takes a `SHARE` lock on `public.gostudy_hour_rewards`, creates the web-owned seen table, and baselines every existing positive reward as seen. The lock makes the cutover exact: concurrent reward inserts wait, so rewards committed after the migration become new. Do not run the migration while holding a long-running transaction that writes hourly rewards.

The `gostudy_web` role receives only `SELECT` and `INSERT` on `public.web_reward_seen_rewards`. Mark-seen writes require an authenticated session and an `Origin` exactly matching `APP_URL`; the server rejects the whole batch if any submitted reward does not belong to that session user. No bot-owned table is modified.

## Study Board API

- `GET /api/board` returns the authenticated user's placed inventory instances.
- `POST /api/board/items` places one owned inventory instance at normalized `x` and `y` coordinates.
- `PATCH /api/board/items/:hourRewardId` saves a placed item's normalized position.
- `DELETE /api/board/items/:hourRewardId` idempotently removes the current user's placement.

Board writes require the request `Origin` to match `APP_URL`. Ownership is derived from the authenticated session and verified against the product inventory tables. A board can contain at most 100 item instances. The web database role needs `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges on `public.web_study_boards` and `public.web_study_board_items`; product-table access remains read-only.

## Production

Set `NODE_ENV=production`, use HTTPS values for `APP_URL` and `DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI`, set `TRUST_PROXY` for the actual reverse-proxy topology, and use certificate verification for PostgreSQL. `npm run build` builds both the Vite app and Express server; `npm start` serves the API, auth routes, and built frontend from one origin.
